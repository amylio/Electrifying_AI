                    <h5 id="rcorners2">The purpose of this project is to conduct an overall analysis of the electric vehicle car market, availability of charging stations, potential climate implications and

                         Electric vehicles currently make up 2% of all cars sold in the US. Many drivers have put off purchasing electric vehicles
                         for many reasons, such as expense and concerns over the accessibility to charging options (e.g. public charging stations,
                         in-home setup). However, current trends show that these statistics are likely to change as the automotive market moves to introduce more affordable models.<br><br>

                        <span>&#8226;</span> Most automakers have committed to all of its sales to be zero-emission, electrified vehicles by 2040 with at least 40% of the sales by 2030.

                <h5 id="rcorners2">We use Machine Learning to explore the relationship of various demographic variables with electric 
                    vehicle ownership to make future predictions on likelihood of EV Ownership. By finding key variables that contribute to whether someone is likely to own an electric vehicle and comparing 
                    those demographics to geographic data such as number of EV Charging Stations, we can propose to public policy makers where might be the next best markets for installing charging stations.<br><br>
                    We approached this with two Machine Learning algorithms: <b>Random Forest Classifier</b> and <b>Decision Tree</b>. Both models achieved an accuracy score of .90. This means that 90% of observation in the 
                    testing set were predicted correctly by the model.<br><br>

                        According to Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle",title="Wikipedia"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1] </a>, "An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses 
                        one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from 
                        off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. 
                        EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft."

                        <br>
                        "Electric vehicles first appeared in the mid-19th century. An electric vehicle held the vehicular land speed record until around 1900. The high cost, low top speed, and 
                        short-range of battery electric vehicles, compared to 20th century internal combustion engine vehicles, led to a worldwide decline in their use as private motor vehicles; 
                        although electric vehicles have continued to be used in the form of loading and freight equipment and public transport – especially rail vehicles."

                        <br>
                        As more car manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz <a href="https://www.mbusa.com/en/eq-electric-cars#what-is-eq",title="Mercedes Benz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a> add EV to their product line, it is expected that Electric Vehicles
                        will be the preferred choice especially as technology improves so will the look and performance. Take a look at some future concepts that are coming to life in 2022:

                    <h4><b>Using Machine Learning to Make a Prediction</b></h4>
                    <p>We are looking to explore the relationships of many different demographic and environmental variables with electric vehicle ownership 
                        and/or electric vehicle charging stations. Will household income be one factor that detemines ownership? Let's see if our predictive model can make that determination 
                        based on your inputs:</p>
